#Example 1: find out the sum of even number from 1 to 10

# sum = 0
# sp = 1

# while sp <= 10:
#     if sp%2==0:
#         sum+=sp
#     sp+=1

# print(sum)

#Example 2: find out the product of even number from 1 to 10

# sp = 1
# product = 1

# while sp <= 10:
#     if sp%2==0:
#         product+=sp
#     sp+=1

# print(product)

#Example 3: find out the factorial of given number.
#5! - 5*4*3*2*1
#6! - 6*5*4*3*2*1

# num = 5
# fact = 1
# i= 1

# while i<=num:
#     fact*=i
#     i+=1

# print(fact)

#Example: Write a program to check a given number is palindrome or not.
#Palidrome Number: number Which looks same after reversing as well.
#1221 <---> 1221 --1221 is a palindrome
#Hint: %, //, /

#Exmaple 4: print from 1 to 10 in one line.

#Soluton 1:
# sp =1
# while sp <= 10:
#     print(sp, end=' ') # default value of end = '\n'
#     sp+=1

#Soluton 2

# bag = ''
# sp = 1
# while sp<=10:
#     bag+=str(sp)+" "
#     sp+=1

# print(bag)
