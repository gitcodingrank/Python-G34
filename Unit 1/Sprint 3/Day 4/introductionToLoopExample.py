#Why Loop: 

#If i ask you to print "Hello World" 10 times?
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")
print("Hello World")

#What if i want you to print "Hello World" 1000 times?
#Yes, you can print 1000 times as well but in this way your code will look less readable, lengthy and harder to maintain.
#In this way your code will have duplicacy/Redundancy, which is not recommended as a developer.

#What is the solution: Loop
