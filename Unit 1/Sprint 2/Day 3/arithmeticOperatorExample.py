#Arithmetic/Mathematical Operator: it is used to perform some mathematical calculation/operations on numberic data values.

#There are following types of Arithematic Operators:
# +(addition), -(subtraction), * (multiplicaiton), /(division), //(Floor Division: Quotient), **(exponent)

#Note: Operator(+, -, *, /, //, **) always operates with operands(data values)
#In other word: particular operator will perform particular operation with variables data, it alwaysa return some resultant value.

#Examples:

# a = 20
# b = 10

# #Addition
# #Operator: +
# #Operands: a and b
# # add = a + b
# # print(add)
# print(a+b) #30

# #Subtraction
# print(a-b) #10

# #Multiplication
# print(a * b) #200

# #Division(/): it returns result in float type.
# print(a / b) #2.0

# #Floor Division(//): it always return integer value.
# print(a//b) #2

# #Exponent(**): its used to find any power of any number

# #Without Exponent
# print(5*5) #25
# print(5*5*5) #125

# #What if i ask to find the 2^10
# print(2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2*2)

# #In this way, you're writing duplicate code or you can your program has redundancy/duplicacy: what is the solution - exponent operator

# print(2**2) #4
# print(4**3) #64

# #Good Example 1: Creata a program where take two integer number input from user and display the sum, multiplication, division, and subtraction.

# # num1 = int(input("Enter Number 1: "))
# # num2 = int(input("Enter Number 2: "))

# # print("Sum of num1 and num2: ", num1 + num2)
# # print("Multiplication of num1 and num2: ", num1 * num2)
# # print("Difference of num1 and num2: ", num1 - num2)
# # print("Division of num1 and num2: ", num1 / num2)

# #Good Example 2: A 30% discount offer is going on flipkart, if you will buy any three products with each product has atleast 3 quantity, your task is to find the payable price after discount according to following data.

# product1Price = 500
# product2Price = 200
# product3Price = 1000

# product1Quantity = 5
# product2Quantity = 3
# product3Quantity = 4

# totalBill = product1Price * product1Quantity  + product2Price * product2Quantity + product3Price * product3Quantity

# print("Total Bill: ", totalBill)

# discount = totalBill * 30/100

# print("Discount on Total Bill: ", discount)

# print("Payable Price", totalBill - discount)


#Mathematical Expression: 
a,b,c = 2, 3, 5
