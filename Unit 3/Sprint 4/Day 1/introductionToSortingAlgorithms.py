#Algorithm: It is step by step solution for particular problem.

#Note: for one problem,we can have n number of algorithms.


#Sorting Algorithm: It is used to arrange the elements in specific order, commonly in ascending or descending order. 

#There are following sorting algorithms:
#1. Selection Sort
#2. Bubble Sort
#3. Insertion Sort
#4. Merge Sort
#5. Quick Sort


#Python Inbuilt function for sorting: 
#ascending - sorted(Iterable, Key=None, reversed=False)
#descending - sorted(Iterable, Key=None, reversed=True)
